* deqn-mode
A single interface for defining differential equations and exporting to various formats.
* Example
Put deqn-mode.el where your emacs can see it, and put the following in your init.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'deqn-mode)
#+end_src
Add the following in a file with a .eqn extension, say model.eqn

#+begin_src text
drabbit = grass*rabbit - fox*rabbit
dfox = fox*rabbit - fox
rabbit = 100
grass = 100
fox = 3
#+end_src

If deqn-mode has been loaded, this text should be syntax highlighted.
Invoke the deqn mode hydra using =C-c h=. 
To export the model to a python PyDSTool format, press =P=. The model file
will be validated. If there are any parameters or initial conditions not specified,
deqn-mode will throw an error. If everything is fine, the file will be written out
to a .py script.
